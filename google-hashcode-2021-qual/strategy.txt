for building the local-simulator simulate the whole process.
Maybe it can be simulated using a queue.
Creating tester for this problem is hard. Explore 'misof' tutorial and code for creating this.



IDEA-1 : (for getting some random)
------

First have the count of cars which goes through each intersection for all the intersections.
Then, for each and every intersection open the traffic lights on the basis of the maximum frequency for that intersection.


total score = 7,230,406

A - 1001
B - 4559622
C - 1,228,351 (98% of the cars reach in time)
D - 0 (change the greedy solution)
E - 675783
F - 765649    


taking the roads in the reverse order :
total score = 7258454

A-2002
B-4560902
C-669701
D-0
E-796552
F-1229297
